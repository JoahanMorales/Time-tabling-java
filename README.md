# time-tabling-java
Timetabling Scheduler in Java  This project implements a basic timetabling system in Java for academic course scheduling. It models subjects, professors, and class times, validates schedule conflicts, and provides a greedy algorithm to generate new groups that maximize professor ratings while avoiding overlapping classes.
